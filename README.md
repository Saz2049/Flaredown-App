Welcome traveler! This is the readme file for my BrainStation Capstone Project: Autoimmune Disease Prediction and Classification. 

In this project, I use supervised machine learning techniques (classification, decision tree, and KNN) to predict autoimmune disease diagnosis (binary and multiclass problems).

Here I'll walk you through the  different parts of the project, including what is included, where it is located, and the suggested order for interacting with it. Let's start with the different parts of the project:

There are several parts to this project: 

1. Four Jupyter Notebooks in the Main Folder <br>
    a. 1-Gates_Flaredown Capstone_Cleaning and Filtering<br>
    b. 2-Gates_Flaredown Capstone_Aggregation and Feature Engineering <br>
    c. 3-Gates_Flaredown Capstone_EDA <br>
    e. 4-Gates_Flaredown Capstone_Modeling 

2. A Data Zip Folder (contains all the csv files required for the project). They are: <br>
    a. chronic.csv <br>
    b. conditions.csv <br>
    c. symptoms.csv <br>
    d. chronic_agg_fibro_binary.csv <br>
    e. chronic_agg_multiclass.csv 

3. A Scripts Folder (My Juypter Notebooks run much faster using scripts than long code within) <br>
    a. data_aggregator.py <br>
    b. entity_resolver.py <br>
    c. filterer.py <br>
    d. variable_splitter 

4. Capstone.yml and envfile.txt file (contains the conda environment for the capstone project) 

5. Final Report Folder-Contains a word doc and pdf of the report summary

6. A folder corresponding to each Jupyter notebook for storing images and figures

7. A folder including the Streamlit Web App file and pickled model.


Suggested order of interaction:

1. Capstone.yml / envfile.txt (to set up conda environment) <br>
2. Gates_Flaredown Capstone_Final Report (for a broad overview)<br>
2. Notebooks in order (1, 2, 3, 4)<br>
3. Scripts on a need-by basis<br>
4. Streamlit App
